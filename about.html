      <h2>About This Experiment</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for your interest in our study, where we examine how clinicians interact 
        with AI-driven medical recommendations. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In this experiment, we use an AI Clinical Decision Support (CDS) platform—powered 
        by a Large Language Model (LLM)—that helps clinicians make better decisions by 
        offering draft recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this experiment, you will engage in answering a demographic questionnaire, analyzing 
        some clinical scenarios and diagnoses provided by AI (which you can trust or not trust), 
        and providing feedback on the AI if you do not trust it. You will also fill out a 
        post-experiment survey. Your answers will be saved on the server once you finish the 
        experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your participation will help us understand how clinicians evaluate and trust AI-generated 
        medical predictions. We appreciate your time and insights, as they will contribute to 
        improving the design and reliability of AI Clinical Decision Support systems for healthcare 
        professionals.
